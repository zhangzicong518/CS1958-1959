How big is the role of luck in career success?
Lubar: lucky beyond all recognition.

Luck plays a big and often unacknowledged part in career success, starting in the womb. Warren Buffett has talked of winning the "ovarian lottery" by being born in America when he was, and being wired in a way that pays off in a market economy. Good looks are associated with higher pay and a greater chance of being called to interview in hiring processes. Your experience of discrimination will reflect your circumstances of birth.

The early way-stations in a career are often marked by chance: a particularly encouraging boss, say, or an assignment that leads you off in an unexpected but defining direction. Luck can affect the pathways of the most rational-minded professions. A paper published in 2022 by Qi Ge of Vassar College and Stephen Wu of Hamilton College found that economists with harder-to-pronounce names, including within ethnic groups, were less likely to be placed into academic jobs or get tenure-track positions.

Names can work against economists in other ways. Another study, by Liran Einav of Stanford University and Leeat Yariv, now of Princeton University, found that faculty with earlier surname initials were more likely to receive tenure at top departments, an effect they put down to the fact that authors of economics papers tend to be listed alphabetically.

Performing well can be due to luck, not talent. In financial markets, asset managers who shine in one period often lose their lustre in the next. The rise of passive investing reflects the fact that few stockpickers are able persistently to outperform the overall market. The history of the oil industry is shot through with stories of unexpected discoveries. A recent paper by Alexei Milkov and William Navidi of the Colorado School of Mines found that 90% of industry practitioners believe that luck affects the outcome of exploration projects. The authors' analysis of 50 years of drilling on the Norwegian Continental Shelf concluded that the differences in success rates between individual firms were random.

There is a long-running debate about whether luck affects executives' pay. A recent paper by Martina Andreani and Lakshmanan Shivakumar of London Business School and Atif Ellahie of the University of Utah suggests that it does. The academics looked at the impact of a big corporate-tax cut in America in 2017, an event which resulted in large one-off tax gains and losses for firms that were based on past transactions and that could not be attributed to managers' skills. They found that larger windfall gains led to higher pay for CEOs of less scrutinised firms; tax losses did not seem to affect their earnings. Lucky things.

Just as some people blindly believe that merit determines success, so it is possible to get too hung up on the role of chance. CEOs may well be rewarded for luck but slogging to the top of companies involves talent and hard work. Although some have argued that entrepreneurs are simply people fortunate enough to have a large appetite for risk, skill does matter. A paper from 2006 by Paul Gompers of Harvard University and his co-authors showed that founders of one successful company have a higher chance of succeeding in their next venture than entrepreneurs who previously failed. Better technology and greater expertise reduce the role of chance; the average success rates in oil exploration, for example, have gone up over time.

But if luck does play a more important role in outcomes than is often acknowledged, what does that mean? For individuals, it suggests you should increase the chances that chance will work in your favour. Partners at y Combinator, a startup accelerator, encourage founders to apply to their programmes by talking about increasing the "surface area of luck": putting yourself in situations where you may be rejected is a way of giving luck more opportunity to strike.

An awareness of the role that luck plays ought to affect the behaviour of managers, too. Portfolio thinking reduces the role of luck: Messrs Milkov and Navidi make the point that the probability of striking it lucky in oil exploration goes up if firms complete numerous independent wells. If luck can mean a bad decision has a good result, or vice versa, managers should learn to assess the success of an initiative on the basis of process as well as outcome.

And if the difference between skill and luck becomes discernible over time, then reward people on consistency of performance, not one-off highs. Mr Buffett might have had a slice of luck at the outset, but a lifetime of investing success suggests he has maximised it.

Can big tech keep getting bigger in the age of AI?
America's digital behemoths face a huge obstacle to growth- their size.

Can anything stop big tech? After a post-lockdown wobble in 2022, America's digital giants have come roaring back. Last week Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all reported robust results in the second quarter, following a stellar set in the first. Between January and June, the three of them together raked in $106bn of operating profits, up by $9bn from the same period last year.Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft lord it over American business. The five firms dominate the S&P 500 stockmarket index, collectively accounting for 9% of its sales, 16% of its net profits and 22% of its market capitalisation. Last year their capital spending of $360bn made up over a tenth of all American business investment. But it is their sustained growth that makes them unique in the history of capitalism. When ExxonMobil and GE were the titans of America Inc in the 1990s and 2000s, their revenues were rising at an average annual rate of 5-6% and their net profits at 5-10% or so. The tech giants' have been growing at 16% and 13%, respectively, for a decade or more.To sustain its long-term average sales growth of 28%, Alphabet needs to add $86bn to its top line in 2024, more than any of the S&P 500's 461 smallest firms generated last year-  and a further $111bn in 2025 and so on, year after exhausting year. To keep profits growing at their historical rates, next year Apple and Alphabet must earn an extra $25bn, or roughly a Meta's worth of net income; Meta must earn a Verizon's. And then they need to beat their own records all over again. Maintaining those averages in the long run is surely asking too much. Indeed, growth has already been less blistering of late. But the firms' bosses and investors are unlikely to settle for a slowdown. If so, they will need to focus on the three main ways that companies have to grow. Could these work for big tech? The first is to pursue profits, and slim down. Cutting costs, scaling back projects and hiving off non-core units is the go-to strategy for a conventional business seeking to cushion its margins. Big tech may be as unconventional as it gets, but it, too, sees the need for a diet. Apple is the only one of the five giants not to have announced lay-offs this year; the others have sacked more than 70,000 workers, all told. Still, the iPhone-maker has pushed back the launch of some new devices. Alphabet has scotched a few cash-burning moonshots bankrolled by Google search. Amazon has abandoned some physical shops. A second route to growth is for companies to go all-in on their core businesses. Microsoft's souped-up AI search engine, Bing, got all the attention earlier this year as a potential Googleslayer. In fact, Bing remains an also-ran in search (the old barb is that its most-searched term was "Google"). But the same ChatGPT-like powers are, with less fanfare, making their way into Microsoft's corporate offering. Last month it said it would make generative-AI tools available to Office 365 users for an extra $30 a month. Google and Meta, for their part, are investing in AI services for their advertising clients. The most ambitious growth strategy is to seek new markets. All five firms are encroaching on each other's turf. Their share of sales in overlapping areas has doubled since 2015, to 40%. Alphabet is elbowing in on Amazon and Microsoft in cloud computing. Amazon and Microsoft are trying their hand at advertising. In June Apple unveiled a virtual-reality headset to compete with Meta, which has so far had that market mostly to itself. All five are also sizing up the last undisrupted markets- including finance, health care and public procurement- that are large enough to make a noticeable difference to their gargantuan revenues. Or, like Microsoft, they may try to buy growth- its $69bn purchase of Activision would bring in annual sales of around $8bn. None of these approaches is foolproof. Slimming down boosts profits for only a year or two, and comes at the expense of future revenues. Big tech's main markets- be they for iPhones, digital ads or business software- are no longer reliably growing at 20% or more. Competing against each other brings fresh revenue but compresses margins. Undisrupted markets are often undisrupted for good reason: they are highly regulated and controlled by incumbents, from Wall Street banks to Pentagon contractors. And not even cash-rich big tech can splurge $69bn for an extra few billion of revenue for long.

Perhaps computing will, one day, eat the world. If so, big tech could use its AI prowess to wrest business from incumbents in all manner of industries- eventually. Between today and eventually, the mix of strategies that each company chooses will speak volumes about how it sees itself. A preference for cost-cutting will signal maturity, but also a lack of faith. A hunger for expansion will hint at self-confidence- or perhaps hubris. Shareholders and executives should brace themselves for a period of uncertainty, as old rents are lost and new ones not yet found. Everybody else will enjoy the wealth of products that big tech dreams up to stay ahead.
